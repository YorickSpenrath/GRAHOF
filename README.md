This is the readme-file.

The uploaded code is a IntelliJ project. It has dependencies on MOA (version 2018.6.0) and Math Commons (3.6.1)

Two uses have been implemented, the visualisation and the experiments.

The visualisation gives a visualisation of GRAHOF under the default settings.
The experiments recreate the experiments in the BPM paper. Both are called in 'MAIN.java' (project root).
